# Resources for CTFs

## General  
* [Kali Linux VM](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4pdiubsd8t5jyec/Kali-Linux-2016.2-vm-amd64.7z?dl=0) with some nice tools on it ;)
* [ctftime](ctftime.org) (Upcoming ctfs being held, links to writeups for old ctfs)
* [overthewire](overthewire.org) (Wargames, basically ctfs that you can play anytime)
* [How to get started with CTFs](https://www.endgame.com/blog/how-get-started-ctf) (General reference guide)
* [Pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) utilities for exploit development
* [root-me challenges](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en) in all CTF categories

## Web Security
* [natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas) (a wargame on overthewire all about web security)
* [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/) (very powerful tool that can automate many sql injections)
* [SQL injection cheat sheet](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/sql-injection-cheat-sheet/)
* [arachni](http://www.arachni-scanner.com/) excellent web scanner utility and library

## Binary Exploitation
* [microcorruption](http://microcorruption.com) (series of challenges teaching basics of binary exploits)
* [RPI Course](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE) (course at RPI about binary exploitation)
* [Exploit exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com/) (a set of wargames)

## Reverse Engineering
* [radare2](http://radare.org/r/): (also known as r2) is a complete framework for reverse-engineering and analyzing binaries; composed of a set of small utilities that can be used together or independently from the command line.
* [x86 Assembly Guide](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html)
* [gdb reference sheet](http://r00ted.com/cheat%20sheet%20reverse%20v6.png)
  * GDB extensions you need:
  * [Voltron](https://github.com/snare/voltron) improves the user experience of various debuggers (LLDB, GDB, VDB and WinDbg) by enabling the attachment of utility views that can retrieve and display data from the debugger host.
  * [Peda](https://github.com/longld/peda) enhances the GDB display and adds useful commands

## Cryptography
* [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)
* [id0](https://id0-rsa.pub/)

## Forensics
* [Forensics Wiki](http://forensicswiki.org/)
* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
* [binwalk](http://binwalk.org/) is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code. Specifically, it is designed for identifying files and code embedded inside of firmware images.
* [Sleuth Kit](http://www.sleuthkit.org/) is a collection of command line tools and a C library that allows you to analyze disk images and recover files from them. It is used behind the scenes in Autopsy and many other open source and commercial forensics tools.

## MIT Resources
* 6.004 - Computation Structures (Covers Assembly)
* 6.857 - Computer and Network Security (Covers Cryptography)
* 6.858 - Computer Systems Security (Covers Binary Exploitation, Web Security)
* 6.875 - Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (Very theoretical, mostly useless for ctfs)
* MIT Reverse Engineering Club (Meets Wednesdays 7-10pm at [Beaverworks](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/))
